Attainment levels were aggregated into broader categories (i.e. any amount of college attainment 
without a degree was combined into 'Some College'). Columns were renamed from their census variable code to more 
descriptive titles to improve readability. Finally, percent of total population was calculated for each aggregated attainment level.
