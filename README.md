Extraction: We used two different sources to extract our data. The first source where we retrieved data from wa the US census american community survey using five year estiments. The data that our group retrieved from that website was intially formated as JSONs. Our group's other data source was the Chicago Data Portal, where the information was formated as csv files.
Transformation:
Load: It was decided that the data would be put into SQL. The reason why SQL was chosen was becaue the data sets would be merged on a single coloumn, joining on zipcode. As such, SQL seemed like the best choice for doing huge joins between datasets.
